# 💒 Smart House Renting Management System.

Tired of rental management chaos? Our automated system handles payments, maintenance, and leases so you can focus on growing your business.

## 📄  What’s This Project About? 
This is a House Rental Management System built with PL/SQL that automates property rentals - handling everything from tenant applications and lease agreements to rent collection, maintenance requests, and financial tracking through intelligent database automation.

This House Rental Management System is a sophisticated database solution built with Oracle PL/SQL to transform property rental operations from chaotic paperwork to streamlined automation. It's my final exam project for Database Development with PL/SQL at Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA), designed to help property managers and landlords with 10-100 rental units transition from messy spreadsheets and manual tracking to an efficient, intelligent management platform.

## 🎯 Phase I: What's the Problem? 😕

### The Big Issues

Most property managers and landlords strugles:

👉**Tenant communications** across multiple channels

👉**Manual rent collection** and payment tracking

👉**Paper-based lease agreements** and renewals

👉**Maintenance request chaos** through calls and messages

👉**Financial reporting** in scattered spreadsheets

### Where it fits:

- 🏠 Property Management Companies - Handling multiple rental properties for owners

- 🏢 Real Estate Agencies - Managing their rental portfolios

- 👨‍💼 Individual Landlords - Owning 5-50 rental units

- 🏘️ Vacation Rental Hosts - Managing short-term and long-term rentals

- 🏬 Commercial Property Managers - Office spaces and retail units

### Who uses it?
- 👨‍⚕️**Property Owners/Landlords:** Manage multiple properties and tenants 

- 🙍‍♂️🙎‍♀️**Tenants:** Search for properties, pay rent, and request maintenance 

- 👨💼**Property Managers:** Oversee properties on behalf of owners 

- 👨‍⚖️**Administrators:** Manage the entire platform

### Our Gaols

- ✅ Reduce administrative time: 20+ hours → 5 hours monthly
- ✅ Increase rent collection rate: 85% → 95% on-time payments
- ✅ Cut maintenance response time: 48 hours → 24 hours average
- ✅ Eliminate manual errors: 100% automated financial calculations
- ✅ Improve tenant satisfaction: Measured via reduced complaints
## 🔄 Phase II: Business Process Modeling (MIS)
House rentals are like well-oiled machines ⚙️—every component needs to work together seamlessly. This system organizes the rental process to make it simple and efficient for both landlords and tenants.

### Main Tasks
**Finding & Renting a Property**
Tenant searches → Views available properties → Applies online → Gets approved → Signs digital lease → Pays deposit.

*Example: A young professional relocating to Kigali finds a 2-bedroom apartment online, applies through the system, gets approved in 24 hours, and moves in the following week.*

**Monthly Rent Cycle**
System generates invoice → Tenant pays → Automatic receipt issued → Late fees applied if overdue → Status updated in real-time.

*Real-World: Properties with automated payment systems see 40% faster rent collection and 30% reduction in late payments (Property Management Report, 2024).*

**Maintenance & Repairs**
Tenant reports issue → System prioritizes urgency → Assigns to vendor → Tracks progress → Updates all parties → Closes ticket.

Example: A tenant reports a leaking pipe through the mobile app, system flags it as "URGENT," assigns a plumber within 2 hours, and tracks repair completion.

**Lease Management**
System tracks lease dates → Sends renewal reminders 60 days early → Processes extensions → Updates terms automatically.

Why It Matters: Automated lease management reduces vacancy rates by 15% and ensures continuous rental income.
